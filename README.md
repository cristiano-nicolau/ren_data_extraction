# REN Data Extraction â€“ Gas and Electricity Monthly Data (Portugal)

This project provides Python scripts to extract and organize monthly **gas** and **electricity** consumption and supply data from the **REN (Redes EnergÃ©ticas Nacionais)** public API in Portugal. The data can be used for analysis, visualization, and reporting purposes.

## What This Does

- Extracts monthly gas and electricity data for each year from **2020 to 2024**.
- Gathers data using the official REN DataHub API.
- Structures the data into a clean `pandas.DataFrame`.
- Reshapes the data so that each row represents a `(year, month)` combination and each metric becomes a column (wide format).
- Data can be saved to `.csv` or used for further analysis/visualization.

## Electricity Data

The electricity data is collected from:
````
https://servicebus.ren.pt/datahubapi/electricity/ElectricityConsumptionSupplyMonthly
````


## ðŸ”¥ Gas Data

The gas data is collected from:
````
https://servicebus.ren.pt/datahubapi/gas/GasConsumptionSupplyMonthly
````

## Data Structure
The data is structured in a wide format, where each row corresponds to a specific year and month, and each column represents a different metric. This allows for easy analysis and visualization of the data.
The data is organized into two main sections: **Gas** and **Electricity**.

Metrics included in the electricity data are:
